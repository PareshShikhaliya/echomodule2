The @Suite annotation is deprecated in JUnit Jupiter 5.8.1 because it is no longer necessary.
JUnit Jupiter 5.8.1 will automatically scan your project for test classes and run them.

The @Suite annotation was originally introduced to allow you to specify the test classes that should be included in a test suite.
However, this is no longer necessary because JUnit Jupiter 5.8.1 can automatically detect your test classes.

The deprecation of the @Suite annotation is part of JUnit Jupiter's effort to make it easier to write and run tests.
By removing unnecessary annotations, JUnit Jupiter is making it easier for developers to get started with testing.
