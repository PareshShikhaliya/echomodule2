mvn site

Maven will execute the site lifecycle phases. During the site phase, it will generate various documentation and reports based on your project's configuration. These files are typically placed in the target/site directory of your project.

You can access the generated documentation and reports by opening the HTML files in a web browser or viewing other formats as needed.

If you want to deploy the generated site to a remote server, additional configuration is required in your project's pom.xml file to specify the deployment destination.

Here's a simplified example of what the mvn site command might produce:

target/site/index.html: The main project documentation.
target/site/apidocs/index.html: Javadoc documentation (if Java code is part of your project).
target/site/surefire-report.html: Test reports.
target/site/checkstyle.html: Checkstyle code analysis report (if configured).
Other reports and documents depending on your project's configuration.
The actual content and structure of the generated site will vary based on your project's configuration and the reports and documents you've specified in your pom.xml file.
