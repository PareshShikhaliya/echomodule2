The mvn clean
command is used to clean a Maven project by deleting the target directory, which contains compiled classes, generated resources, and other build artifacts.

validate:

Example: mvn validate
Explanation: The validate phase is used to validate the correctness of the project's metadata (the pom.xml file) and other project-specific settings. It checks if the project is well-formed and has all the necessary information.
Use Case: This phase is often used as an initial check to ensure that your project's configuration is correct before proceeding with other build phases.
compile:

Example: mvn compile
Explanation: The compile phase compiles the source code of the project. It takes the Java source code files (*.java) and produces compiled bytecode (*.class) files.
Use Case: This phase is used to compile your project's source code so that it can be executed or further processed.
test:

Example: mvn test
Explanation: The test phase runs tests for the classes compiled in the previous compile phase. It executes unit tests to ensure the code behaves correctly.
Use Case: This phase is essential for automated testing, allowing you to verify that your code meets its functional requirements.
package:

Example: mvn package
Explanation: The package phase packages the compiled classes, resources, and other artifacts
into a distributable format, such as a JAR (Java Archive), WAR (Web Application Archive), ZIP, etc.
Use Case: This phase creates deployable artifacts that can be distributed or deployed to a server.
verify:

Example: mvn verify
Explanation: The verify phase verifies the correctness of the artifact created in the previous package phase. It often includes additional checks or validations to ensure the quality of the artifact.
Use Case: This phase is useful for running integration tests or additional quality checks on the generated artifact.
install:

Example: mvn install
Explanation: The install phase installs the artifact (e.g., JAR, WAR) into your local Maven repository (~/.m2/repository). This makes it available for other projects on your local machine.
Use Case: Installing an artifact locally allows you to use it as a dependency in other Maven projects without having to publish it to a remote repository.
deploy:

Example: mvn deploy
Explanation: The deploy phase deploys the artifact to a remote repository, typically a remote Maven repository or a production server. It makes the artifact available for others to use.
Use Case: This phase is used in the context of releasing or sharing your project with others. It's commonly used for deploying artifacts to a central Maven repository or a production server for application deployment.
