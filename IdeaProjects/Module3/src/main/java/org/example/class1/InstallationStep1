Step 1: Install Java

Before you can use Maven, ensure you have Java installed on your machine. You can download and install Java from the official Oracle website or use OpenJDK.

Step 2: Download and Install Maven

Visit the official Apache Maven website (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and download the latest binary distribution of Maven.

Once downloaded, unzip the archive to your preferred directory on your computer.

Add the "bin" directory of the Maven installation to your system's PATH environment variable.
This step allows you to run Maven from any command prompt or terminal.

Step 3: Verify Maven Installation

Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command to ensure Maven is installed and configured correctly:

mvn -version
You should see Maven's version information displayed.

Step 4: Create a New Maven Project

Now that you have Maven installed, let's create a new Maven project.

Open a command prompt or terminal.

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your Maven project.

Use the following command to generate a new Maven project (replace com.example and my-project with your own values):


mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example -DartifactId=my-project -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false
This command uses a Maven archetype (a project template) to create a simple Java project. You can choose different archetypes depending on your project's requirements.

Step 5: Explore the Project Structure

After running the above command, you'll find a new directory called my-project (or whatever you specified as artifactId) containing your Maven project. Inside this directory, you'll see a basic project structure with source code and configuration files:

src/main/java: This is where your Java source code goes.
src/test/java: This is where your unit tests go.
pom.xml: This is the project's configuration file where you define dependencies, plugins, and other project settings.
Step 6: Build and Test Your Project

To build your project using Maven, navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command:


mvn clean install
This command will compile your code, run tests (if any), and package your application (typically a JAR file).

Step 7: Manage Dependencies

Maven makes it easy to manage external libraries (dependencies).
 You can specify dependencies in your project's pom.xml file. Maven will download and include these dependencies in your project automatically.

To add a dependency, edit your pom.xml file, add the dependency details within the <dependencies> section, and then run mvn clean install to update your project's dependencies.

That's a basic overview of how to get started with Maven. As your project grows, you can further customize your pom.xml file to suit your specific requirements, add plugins for additional functionality,
and use Maven for tasks like generating documentation or creating distributable packages.
